                In his opening remarks at the climate summit plenary session, President Costa emphasized the critical timing of COP30 in the fight against climate change and the need for multilateral action to face the climate emergency.

                COP30 is taking place at a decisive moment in our fight against climate change. The window of opportunity to act and avoid irreversible impacts on humanity and nature is closing fast. The existential threat posed by climate change in particular impels the European Union’s unwavering commitment to the Paris Agreement.

               President Costa

                Over the summer, clubs across the world spent $9.76 billion on acquiring about 12,000 new players.

                Both numbers were record highs, according to FIFA. Around 1,000 more players changed teams in 2025 than did in 2024, and the near-$10 billion outlay was a more-than-50% increase over the summer spending in the previous year.

                Most of the money was spent by UEFA clubs: $8.5 billion, which was a $3 billion increase from just the year before. About 7,350 players joined new teams in UEFA, around 20% of those players required transfer fees to acquire, and the average price of those transfer fees was $4.27 million -- a $1.2 million per-deal average increase from 2024.
                Unsurprisingly, most of that money was spent by members of the Big Five top leagues in Europe and their associated lower-down-the-ladder clubs. England led the way with $3.19 billion spent on transfers, while Spain, Germany, France, and Italy all spent over $650 million, too. All in all, clubs across these five countries spent $6.5 billion -- two-thirds of the entire global transfer spend.

                Redmi CEO Wang Teng Thomas said that in China Redmi K80 Ultra set a record for sales among smartphones 2025, beating competitors in all price segments at the end of the first 4 hours, and the volume of orders is approaching YU7. Recall, in the first four hours after the presentation, the number of orders for the electric car was 240 thousand, hence, the new smartphone approached the same sales figures.

                Redmi K80 Ultra features a 6.83″OLED screen, MediaTek Dimensity 9400+ chipset (3nm, Cortex-X925, 3.73 GHz), Immortalis-G925 graphics, LPDDR5X memory and UFS 4.1.

                It set a performance record in AnTuTu V10, scoring 3.24 million points and for all its virtues, it is priced at just $360 (base version).
