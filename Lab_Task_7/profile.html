        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
            I am a dedicated Computer Science student with a good understanding of software development, algorithms, and data structures. I have built many responsive web pages using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I also work with backend tools like Python and Node.js. Through my projects and courses, I have learned about web development, databases, machine learning basics. I also have experience using Java and C# to create a project in management system. I enjoy solving hard problems, improving code performance, and creating user-friendly designs.

              Outside my studies, I take part in small open-source projects, and work with friends on full-stack applications. I am especially interested in artificial intelligence(AI), data-based applications, simple and accessible UI design. I like breaking big problems into small steps, testing each part, and learning new tools whenever needed.

              My journey in computer science is guided by constant learning and applying theory in real projects. I work well in teams and always try to write clean, organized code that follows best practices. I am committed to staying updated with new technologies and improving my skills every day.
